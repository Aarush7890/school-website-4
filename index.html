                    <p>Budding cricketer from Apeejay School, Noida, Nirmalya Nath (Class X A) participated in the New Zealand Cricket Tour 2018 from October 25, 2018 to November 6, 2018, organised by Alien Sports Management after a rigorous selection process by their Coach.

                        His team played a total of six matches, 5 of them in Auckland and 1 in Hamilton with teams of North Harbor Cricket Academy, Westlake Boys and Kings College from Auckland and Hamilton Boys High School, Hamilton.

                        During the tour, Nirmalya acquired more skills in the game and most importantly he learnt their way of playing the beautiful game. He also got an insight into the culture and lifestyle of New Zealand.

                        Nirmalya has received a lifetime membership from the North Shore Cricket Club, Devonport (NSCC).</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                        2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                        3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
